## About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/){:target="_blank"}, working with [Dr. Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/index.html){:target="_blank"}. I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en){:target="_blank"}, Finland, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aristides Gionis](https://www.kth.se/profile/argioni){:target="_blank"}. During my master’s studies, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant with [Prof. Petteri Kaski](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/pkaski/){:target="_blank"} at Aalto University. Before starting my master's studies, I worked as a (research) engineer at Nokia, Motorola, and Ericsson.

## Research Interests
My primary research interest lies in the design of algorithms with provable theoretical guarantees, with an emphasis on _responsible computing_ in automated decision-making systems, prioritizing design choices that mitigate systemic biases, unfairness and discrimination. My PhD research focused on designing scalable algorithms for societal challenges, including modeling epidemic propagation and developing algorithms for fair variants of unsupervised machine learning problems such as clustering and feature selection. More recently, I have been exploring the design algorithmic decision-support systems that encourage effective human-AI interaction—so that humans and algorithms together can perform better than either could alone—with the goal of achieving human-AI complementarity.

- **Responsible Computing:** algorithmic fairness, algorithmic bias, explainability
- **Combinatorial Optimization:** approximation algorithms, parameterized algorithms
- **Behavioural Psychology:** bias and (ir)rationality in human judgement
