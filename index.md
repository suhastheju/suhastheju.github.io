## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), working with [Dr. Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/index.html). I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aristides Gionis](https://www.kth.se/profile/argioni). During my master’s studies, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant with [Prof. Petteri Kaski](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/pkaski/). Before starting my doctoral studies, I worked as a research engineer at Nokia, Motorola, and Ericsson.

My primary research interest lies in the design of algorithms with provable theoretical guarantees, with a strong emphasis on _responsible computing_ in automated decision-making systems, prioritizing design choices that mitigate biases, unfairness and discrimination. My Phd research focused on designing scalable algorithms for societal challenges, including modeling epidemic propagation and developing algorithms for fair variants of combinatorial optimization problems. More recently, I have been exploring how to design algorithmic decision-support systems that encourage effective human-AI interaction—so that humans and algorithms together can perform better than either could alone, with the goal of achieving human-AI complementarity.

## Research Interests

- **Responsible Computing:** algorithmic fairness, accountability and governance
- **Combinatorial Optimization:** approximation algorithms, parameterized algorithms
- **Behavioural Psychology:** bias and (ir)rationality in human judgement
